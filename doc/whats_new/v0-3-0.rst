v0.3.0 - Someversion (somemonth, someday, 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- Make entropy and specific volume available after simulation. Additionally,
  the method :py:meth:`tespy.connections.connection.get_fluid_properties` may
  be used, to return the full fluids state of a connection: Pressure,
  specific enthalpy, temperature, specific volume, specific entropy and
  vapour mass fraction (`PR #172 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/172>`_).
- Connections, components and busses are now easily accessible on every
  network. Connections now have a label, which can be specified individually,
  the default value of the label is given by the following logic.
  :code:`source:source_id_target:target_id`, where source and target are the
  labels of the connected components.

  Access the objects with:

  - mynetwork.busses['mybuslabel']
  - mynetwork.components['mycomponentlabel']
  - mynetwork.connections['myconnectionlabel']

  (`PR #173 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/173>`_).

Bug fixes

Other changes
#############
- Improve naming in networks, components and connections modules
  (`PR #172 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/172>`_,
   `PR #175 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/175>`_).

Changes in the API
##################
The changes affect

- reading design point information from the :code:`design_path`.
- reading starting value information from the :code:`init_path`
- and loading networks with the network reader's
  :py:meth:`tespy.networks.network_reader.load_network` method.

Data generated in older versions of TESPy can not be imported. In order to fix
this follow the steps below.

- rename the :code:`comps` folder to :code:`components`
- rename the :code:`conns.csv` file to :code:`connections.csv`

and within the file rename the columns

- :code:`s` to :code:`source`
- :code:`s_id` to :code:`source_id`
- :code:`t` to :code:`target`
- :code:`t_id` to :code:`target_id`

If you want to use the network reader,

- create a :code:`network.json` file.
- add the desired contents as listed below.

The fluids are represented in a dictionary containing the fluid's names as keys
and the CoolProp backend as value. "HEOS" is the default backend, which has
been used until version 0.2.x in TESPy.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "fluids":
        {
            "H2O": "IF97",
            "CO2": "TTSE",
            "O2": "HEOS",
            "N2": "BICUBIC&HEOS",
        },
        "T_unit": "C",
        "h_unit": "kJ / kg",
        "m_unit": "kg / s",
        "T_range": [150, 200]
    }
