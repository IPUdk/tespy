Tutorial/Examples
=================

We provide two different tutorials for you to get started with TESPy. You will learn how to create basic models and get an idea of the design process of a thermal process plant. On top of that, we created a tutorial for the usage of the combustion chamber: It is an important component for thermal power plants while beeing a source for many errors in the calculation. Additional examples can be downloaded from the `github repository <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/tree/master/examples>`_.
