Online meetings
===============
We have decided to start a reoccurring meeting for all interested TESPy users
and (potential) developers. You are invited to join us on every 3rd Monday of a
month at 17:00 CE(S)T. The first meeting will be held at June, 20, 2022.

The intent of this meeting is to establish a more active and well connected
network of TESPy users and developers. Participants will have a space to present
and discuss their models, get help and exchange experience with others, learn
about new features or suggest improvements or new features.

The preliminary schedule is as follows:

* 17:00 – 17:05: Short intro
* 17:05 – 17:50: User presentations and discussion
* 17:50 – 18:00: Break
* 18:00 – 18:40: New feature presentation/discussion, tutorial session
* 18:40 – 18:45: Feedback

.. note::

    The meetings will thrive through active participation. If you have
    suggestions for topics - **from beginner tutorial to suggestion or**
    **discussion of specific new features** - please let us know your interest
    when registering to the meeting. We appreciate your contribution!

To get a better overview on the number of participants and to plan the agenda
of each meeting accordingly, **please send an e-mail to**
**francesco.witte(at)dlr.de for registration**.

We are looking forward to meeting you!

User forum
==========

We have implemented a
`discussion room on GitHub <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/discussions>`__ as
user forum. If you have issues with setting up your model or any other question
about using the software, you are invited to start a discussion there.

In-person meetings
==================

Currently, no in-person meetings are scheduled. We will update this section, as
soon as a meeting is planned.
