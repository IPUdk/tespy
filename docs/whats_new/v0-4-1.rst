+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- Add functionalities for user defined functions. The user can define
  individual functions that can be applied on connection parameters. E.g. in
  order to couple mass flow values at some point of the network to temperature
  values at a different point. Generic equations can be applied: There are no
  restrictions as long as the partial derivatives are provided correctly. For
  an extensive example have a lookt at the API documentation of class
  :py:class:`tespy.tools.helpers.UserDefinedFunction`
  (`PR #245 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/245>`_).
