v0.0.2 (April 07, 2018)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- Changed architecture of the variables and component parameters. Every parameter is now a data container, giving the user more flexibility (e. g. specifiying a unit) and facilitating future development.
- Changed architecture of fluid property function calls to make custom fluids or custom fluid property functions available.
- Added custom fluid class to generate fluid properties from given fluid mixture.
- Added generic component characteristics for turbine isentropic efficiency and cone law as well as for the heat exchangers heat transfer coefficient.
  On top, the user may use own values for the characteristic lines.

Documentation
