v0.6.0 - Colored Chemicals (March, 12, 2022)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- A new component is introduced, the DiabaticCombustionChamber:
  :py:class:`tespy.components.combustion.diabatic.DiabaticCombustionChamber`.
  In contrast to the adiabatic combustion chamber, the new component implements
  pressure and heat losses. An example usage can be found in the API reference
  of the class linked above
  (`PR #301 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/301>`_).
- Gaseous mixtures now check for condensation of water in enthalpy and entropy
  are functions (`PR #318 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/318>`_).

Bug Fixes
#########
- Calculation of entropy for gaseous mixtures included the pressure correction
  term although the entropy values of the mixture components were calculated at
  their respective partial pressure
  (`PR #318 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/318>`_).
