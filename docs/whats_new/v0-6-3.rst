v0.6.3 - Development in Progress
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- A new TESPy logger has been implemented to capture TESPy specific loggings
  with a constant string id for the logger object that is retrieved from the
  logging module. This allows to modify the logging functionality in a
  programmatic way and simplifies the work that has to be done in libraries and
  applications that consume the TESPy library
  (`PR #390 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/390>`__).
- A progress bar for the iterations has been integrated
  (`PR #391 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/391>`__).

Bug Fixes
#########
- The pressure ratio of the
  :py:class:`tespy.components.combustion.diabatic.DiabaticCombustionChamber`
  was never calculated in postprocessing if not specified from user
  (`PR #380 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/380>`_).
- Heat exchangers will now provide a result for the logarithmic temperature
  difference and the heat transfer coefficient in case the values of the upper
  and lower temperature difference are equal. Some issues in such situations
  remain when in offdesign mode
  (`PR #396 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/396>`__).
