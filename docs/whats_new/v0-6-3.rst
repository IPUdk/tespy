v0.6.3 - Development in Progress
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- A new TESPy logger has been implemented to capture TESPy specific loggings
  with a constant string id for the logger object that is retrieved from the
  logging module. This allows to modify the logging functionality in a
  programmatic way and simplifies the work that has to be done in libraries and
  applications that consume the TESPy library
  (`PR #390 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/390>`__).
